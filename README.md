## Background & Interests
I'm a competitive gamer turned data nerd after delving into the world of SQL and Python. What started as a hobby to get a competitive edge paved the way into a career.
- üìä Current projects are a Steam game analysis in Python and visualization in Power BI, and a used car aftermarket analysis in Python & Excel (maybe some visualization in Power BI?).
- ü•Ö Current goal is getting the PL-300 certification from Microsoft for Power BI.
- üëØ I‚Äôm open to collaborate on new projects.
- üìù You can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephhmltn/).
- üö≤ My hobbies are hiking, biking, spelunking, video games, and D&D with friends.
- üéâ Fun fact about me: I dyed my hair completely white while studying abroad in Japan in order to use it as an ice breaker to teach English to shy Japanese students.
